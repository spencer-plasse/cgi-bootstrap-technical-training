#  Bootstrap / HTML5 Technical Training Project

Hey there! My name is Spencer Plasse. I've been a Consultant at CGI in Mobile, AL since January 2022. Part of my job responsibility as a consultant is to engage in continual learning to maintain a fresh and valuable skill set that makes me an asset to the company and its clients. This web application project was developed over the past couple of weeks to complete the CGI Bootstrap / HTML5 Technical Training in my endeavor to learn more about web design/development.

Below are project setup instructions as well as descriptions of the major project folders and files that I have modified/created. I started this project without a template but ended up adding files to support a localhost server and Sass.

Let me know if you have any questions or comments!

##  Tech Stack

This project was developed with **HTML5**, **Bootstrap v5.2**, **JavaScript**, and **Sass**. Below are links to the documentation for each of these frameworks:

- **Bootstrap v5.2** - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/
- **JavaScript** - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript
- **Sass** - https://sass-lang.com/

##  Project Setup

To set this project up to run locally, follow the below steps:
- Open command prompt to a suitable location using `cd`.
- Run `git clone https://github.com/spencer-plasse/cgi-bootstrap-technical-training.git`.
- Run `cd cgi-bootstrap-technical-training`.
- Run `git status` to make sure you have the `main` branch checked out (this should be the default).
- Run `npm install` and verify that all project dependencies listed in `package.json` are installed correctly.
- Run `npm start --host` while in the root folder of the project.
- Open a web browser (I tested in Google Chrome) to `http://localhost:3000` and voila!
