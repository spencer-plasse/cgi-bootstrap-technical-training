            <p>
              Hey there! My name is Spencer Plasse. I was born and raised in Mobile, AL and currently live in the West Mobile
              area with my wife, 3 dogs, and multiple cats.
              <br /><br />
              In my free time, I enjoy playing, listening to, and composing music. My favorite genres are alternative/indie,
              country, and video-game soundtracks (which I compose). I play piano often as well as some guitar and bass.
              I'm a big PC and Nintendo Switch gamer as well. My favorite games include Minecraft, Undertale, Rocket League,
              Hollow Knight, Don't Starve Together, and Enter the Gungeon.
              <br /><br />
              I joined CGI in January 2022 and am a P2 Consultant at the Mobile, AL office. I've been working on the NASBA
              Gateway 3.0 project since completing Boot Camp. During this time, I've had the opportunity to develop back-end
              code for AWS Lambda functions with Python, integrate them with many AWS services in a Serverless architecture,
              and design and develop React front-end pages and modals.
