                Hey there! My name is Spencer Plasse and I am 22 years old. I was born and raised in Mobile, AL, and currently
                live in the West Mobile area with my wife, 3 dogs, and multiple cats. We are also expecting our first child this
                month (September 2023)!
                <br /><br />
                In my free time, I enjoy playing, listening to, and composing music. My favorite genres are alternative/indie,
                country, and video-game soundtracks (which I also compose). I play piano often as well as some guitar and bass.
                I'm a big PC and Nintendo Switch gamer as well. My favorite games include Minecraft, Undertale, Rocket League,
                Hollow Knight, Don't Starve Together, and Enter the Gungeon.
                <br /><br />
                I love to travel. My favorite trip so far has been for my wife and I's 1-year anniversary where we flew out west
                for the first time to Las Vegas. The city itself was a cultural shock having lived in the south our whole lives,
                but we loved the experience. We also got to visit the Grand Canyon (which was covered in snow), stay in
                Flagstaff, AZ for a few days, and eat plenty of In-N-Out.
                <br /><br />
                I joined CGI in January 2022 and am a P2 Consultant at the Mobile, AL office. I have been privileged to have worked
                on a number of projects since joining, including Boot Camp, two clients, four technical trainings, and assisting
                with new YEET development, all of which can be viewed <a href="project-history.html" class="text-decoration-none">here</a>.
